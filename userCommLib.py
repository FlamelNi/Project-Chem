# readPrevMessage()
#     get previous message printed on console

#     display arg to console.
#     * display must be used so that readPrevMessage can work.
#       if regular print function is used,
#       readPrevMessage will NOT read your message
#     * if doPrint is False, then it will update

# help(arg1='', arg2='')
#     prints all possible commands

# chk(arg1, arg2='')
#     prints the actual substance in arg1

# crg
#     *This is function for command 'chr'
#      The reason for this being named as 'crg' is because
